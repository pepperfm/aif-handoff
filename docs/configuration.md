# Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Node packages (`@aif/api`, `@aif/agent`, `@aif/data`, `@aif/shared`) auto-load env from monorepo root at startup:

- `.env`
- `.env.local` (loaded after `.env`, overrides duplicate keys)

## Environment Variables

| Variable                           | Type    | Default             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                | string  | _(optional)_        | Anthropic API key. The Agent SDK uses `~/.claude/` credentials by default, so this is only needed if you want to use a separate key                                                                                                                                     |

Environment validation is handled by Zod in `packages/shared/src/env.ts`. The application will fail to start with a descriptive error if required variables are invalid.

## Authentication

The Agent SDK supports two authentication methods:

1. **Default (recommended):** Uses your active Claude subscription credentials from `~/.claude/`. No configuration needed.
2. **API Key:** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to use a dedicated key.

### Runtime Readiness Check

API exposes `GET /agent/readiness` to verify auth state at runtime:

- `ready=true`: agent can run AI stages.
- `ready=false`: neither `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` nor Claude profile auth was detected.
- The web app shows a warning banner when `ready=false`.

## Database

The database is a single SQLite file. The default path `./data/aif.sqlite` is relative to the project root.

Runtime DB access is centralized in `@aif/data`. `@aif/api` and `@aif/agent` are lint-restricted from importing DB helpers and SQL builders directly.

To use a different location:

```
DATABASE_URL=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite
```

Initialize the schema with:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

## Logging

Pino structured JSON logging is used throughout. Set `LOG_LEVEL` to control verbosity:

| Level   | Use Case                                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trace` | Very verbose, includes all internal details                       |
| `debug` | Development default — shows DB queries, WS events, agent activity |
| `info`  | Production — key events only                                      |
| `warn`  | Warnings and deprecations                                         |
| `error` | Errors only                                                       |
| `fatal` | Application crashes                                               |

Each package creates a named logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@aif/shared";
const log = logger("my-module");
log.info({ key: "value" }, "Something happened");
```

Agent query audit logs are controlled by `AGENT_QUERY_AUDIT_ENABLED`. When enabled, query payloads are written to `logs/{agentName}.log` with rotation.

### Activity Logging

Activity logging tracks tool events during agent runs. Two modes are available:

- **`sync`** (default): Each tool event is written to the database immediately via `select+update`. Safe and simple but generates one DB write per event.
- **`batch`**: Tool events are buffered in memory and flushed in batches. Reduces DB write amplification at the cost of slight delay in log visibility. Flush triggers: batch size limit (`ACTIVITY_LOG_BATCH_SIZE`), max age timer (`ACTIVITY_LOG_BATCH_MAX_AGE_MS`), and explicit flush on stage boundaries/shutdown.

The queue is bounded by `ACTIVITY_LOG_QUEUE_LIMIT` to prevent unbounded memory growth — when the limit is reached, the oldest entries are dropped and a warning is logged.

## Agent Polling

The coordinator checks for actionable tasks every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` milliseconds (default: 30 seconds). Lower values mean faster task processing but more CPU usage.

For development, 30 seconds is a good default. In production, adjust based on your workload.

### Query Startup Timeout

Subagent query startup has a dedicated guard:

- If no first stream message arrives within `AGENT_QUERY_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, the run is marked as `query_start_timeout`.
- The coordinator performs one automatic retry after `AGENT_QUERY_START_RETRY_DELAY_MS`.
- If the second attempt also times out, normal error handling applies (stage failure path).

### Stale Task Watchdog

The coordinator includes a stale-stage watchdog:

- Tracks task liveness via `lastHeartbeatAt` (falls back to `updatedAt` for older rows).
- Effective stale baseline uses the freshest of `lastHeartbeatAt` and `updatedAt`.
- If a task is stale in `planning`, `implementing`, or `review` for longer than `AGENT_STAGE_STALE_TIMEOUT_MS`, it is auto-moved to `blocked_external` with backoff.
- If stale recovery count reaches `AGENT_STAGE_STALE_MAX_RETRY`, the task stays in `blocked_external` without `retryAfter` (manual intervention required).
- For stale `implementing` tasks, recovery resumes from `plan_ready` to avoid half-broken implementation continuation.
- Any valid human/stage transition resets stale-retry debt (`retryCount=0`) and refreshes heartbeat baseline.

## Agent Permissions

Subagents (planner, implementer, reviewer) run shell commands during task execution. By default, permission mode is `acceptEdits` — file edits are auto-approved, but Bash commands like `npm install` require explicit allow rules.

Two approaches:

### Option 1: Bypass all permissions (simple)

`AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=true` is the default. All tool calls are auto-approved without prompting. Convenient for trusted environments and local development.

```
AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=true
```

### Option 2: Configure allow rules (granular)

Set `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=false` and add needed commands to `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm install:*)",
      "Bash(npm run:*)",
      "Bash(npm test:*)",
      "Bash(npx:*)",
      "Bash(git:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Unlisted commands will be denied in headless agent mode. See [Claude Code permissions docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/permissions) for the full rule syntax.

## Parallel Execution (Experimental)

By default, the coordinator processes one task at a time per project. Parallel execution allows multiple tasks to run concurrently for projects that opt in.

### Setup

1. Set the global concurrency cap in `.env`:

```
COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=3
```

2. Enable per-project in the web UI: open project settings and toggle **Parallel Execution**.

### How It Works

- The coordinator reads each task's project `parallelEnabled` flag to determine concurrency:
  - **Parallel off** (default): 1 task per project at a time — identical to serial behavior
  - **Parallel on**: up to `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` tasks per project per stage
- `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` is also the **global cap** on total concurrent tasks across all stages and projects. With the default of 3, at most 3 Claude agent processes run simultaneously regardless of how many parallel-enabled projects exist
- Tasks within a stage run concurrently via `Promise.allSettled` — a failure in one task does not block others
- Tasks are atomically claimed via `lockedBy` / `lockedUntil` columns to prevent duplicate picks
- Lock duration is tied to the stage timeout (`AGENT_STAGE_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` + 5 min buffer). Heartbeats renew the lock periodically, so long-running stages keep their claim alive
- Stale claims are auto-released at the start of each poll cycle: expired TTL, or dead heartbeat (> 5 min with no update) on in-progress tasks
- On graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM), all active task locks are released immediately

### Constraints

When parallel mode is enabled for a project, tasks are forced to `mode = full` (creates git branch/worktree per task) to ensure code isolation between concurrent agents. The UI disables mode selection and auto-generates unique plan file paths. The API enforces these constraints: creating a task in a parallel project auto-sets `plannerMode=full`, and updating to `fast` mode returns a 400 error.

### Monitoring

The coordinator logs concurrency state at `debug` level:

- `"Stage at capacity, skipping"` — stage has reached its concurrency limit
- `"Task claim failed (already claimed)"` — another poll cycle is already processing this task
- `"Task candidates selected"` with `candidateCount` — number of tasks picked for parallel processing

## Agent Budgets

Agent budgets are configured per project (API or Project edit dialog):

- `plannerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `planCheckerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `implementerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `reviewSidecarMaxBudgetUsd` (applies to each review/security sidecar)

If any of these values are not set, that agent runs without SDK budget limit.

## Telegram Notifications

Best-effort Telegram messages on task status changes. Add to `.env`:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...
TELEGRAM_USER_ID=987654321
```

| Variable             | Type   | Default      | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | string | _(optional)_ | Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)                |
| `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`   | string | _(optional)_ | Your Telegram user ID (the bot sends direct messages to this user) |

When both variables are set, every `task:moved` event sends a short message with the task title and status transition. If delivery fails (network error, invalid token, etc.), nothing breaks — failures are logged at `debug` level and silently ignored.

To get your user ID, message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or any similar bot on Telegram.

## Project Config (config.yaml)

Per-project configuration is stored in `.ai-factory/config.yaml` at the project root. When present, its values override built-in defaults for artifact paths and workflow settings. When absent, the system uses hardcoded defaults transparently.

The config is editable via the **Global Settings** dialog in the web UI (gear icon in the header).

### Sections

| `architecture` | `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `docs`         | `docs/`                       |
| `rules_file`   | `.ai-factory/RULES.md`        |
| `references`   | `.ai-factory/references/`     |

**`workflow`** — controls AI Factory workflow behavior:

| `analyze_updates_architecture` | `true`   | boolean                       |
| `architecture_updates_roadmap` | `true`   | boolean                       |
| `verify_mode`                  | `normal` | `strict`, `normal`, `lenient` |

**`git`** — git-aware workflow settings:

| Key                      | Default    | Description                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                | `true`     | Use git-aware workflows            |
| `base_branch`            | `main`     | Default branch for diff/review     |
| `create_branches`        | `true`     | Auto-create feature branches       |
| `branch_prefix`          | `feature/` | Prefix for branch names            |
| `skip_push_after_commit` | `false`    | Skip push prompt after /aif-commit |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path                      | Description                                |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/settings/config/status` | Check if config.yaml exists                |
| GET    | `/settings/config`        | Read parsed config as JSON                 |
| PUT    | `/settings/config`        | Write config (accepts JSON, saves as YAML) |
| GET    | `/projects/:id/defaults`  | Get resolved paths/workflow for a project  |

### How It Works

The `getProjectConfig(projectRoot)` utility in `@aif/shared` reads and caches config.yaml per project. All consumers (planner, implementer, task events, roadmap generation) call this function instead of using hardcoded paths. The cache is invalidated when the file's mtime changes.
